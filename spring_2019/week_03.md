## Last Week's Accomplishments

Drew out a more detailed idea of the actual logistics behind getting our stats.
We decided how and what data we want to display exactly, and how to calculate and
access such data from the database. We also decided to only use assignment data
for our stats for the moment as exam data can be inaccurate and not really quantified
as easily as assignments.

## This Week's Plan

Meet and divvy up tasks and start to fully implement the stats page. As the
leader of this small sub group in late, I will be in charge of figuring out
who can do what based on experience.

## Anything Blocking?

No

## Notes
