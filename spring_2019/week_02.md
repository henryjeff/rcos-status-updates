## Last Week's Accomplishments

Continued implementation of the page and route into late, and started designing
the stats page itself. We decided on the chart library vue-chart.js and next week
we will continue to look into making and charting the data.

## This Week's Plan

Continue to implement and figure out how we are going to get the data we need for
the stats we want to display. We will look into what sort of information is
stored for every user and compile a useful list of raw data we can access to
generate the data.

## Anything Blocking?

No
