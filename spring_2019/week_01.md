## Last Week's Accomplishments

Planned out the stats page with my Sub-Group. As the lead we figured out the most
important statistics to display and how to display them.  We decided on using
a doughnut chart to show all the Assignments you have to do and have done along
with the, all the amount of time you have spent on every class.

## This Week's Plan

Implement the statistics page and route into LATE. This will require modifying
the backend and making new components for the page itself. This will require
importing a new vue component for the charts so we can display the data nicely.

## Anything Blocking?

No

## Notes

None
